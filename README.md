## Resource behavior

### `check`

Retrieves and returns all or newer versions available of the package.

### `in`

Retrieves a specific version of the package.
The file is saved in the target directory, preserving the name of the package.
It also populates a `version` file, containing the package version.

### `out`

Not implemented.
This resource is read-only.

## Development
